In this capstone project, we developed comprehensive Profit and Loss (P&L) statements for two fictitious companies, InnovateTech and GreenEats, for their first 12 months of operation. The goal was to analyze their financial performance, identify key cost drivers, and provide recommendations for improving profitability.
